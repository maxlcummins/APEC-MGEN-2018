To generate a Phylosift with a table showing gene presence and absence a Phylosift tree was generated as shown in [part two of this wiki](https://github.com/maxlcummins/APEC-MGEN-2018/wiki/2.-Generation-of-Phylosift-tree-and-subsequent-annotation-in-iTOL).

Note that the reference genomes were not included in the generation of this Phylosift tree as these reference sequences were not genotyped by the use of ARIBA.

The R package [ggtree](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu) played an important role in the generation of this figure, so thanks to Guangchuang Yu for his work on the package.

The script utilised is accessible [here](https://github.com/maxlcummins/APEC-MGEN-2018/blob/master/BigChook_tree_gene_table.R)
